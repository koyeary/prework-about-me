      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a full-stack web developer. Nice to meet you.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in a small town in Idaho. If you're thinking potatoes, 4-H, and Napoleon Dynamite, you're not far off.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm an aspiring rennaissance (wo)man. I translate (French-to-English), paint, and if you googled me, you probably figured out that I'm a working stand-up comic.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to be challenged. As a developer, I'm looking for an organization that requires innovative (and quick) solutions using the latest technology. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Los Angeles, CA. I'd love it if you were close to home, and I'm happy to work remotely if you're not.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p> Short answer: it fascinates me. <br><br>Long answer: a web developer turns language into objects. It's the only job that perfectly combines my fascination with language and translation, addiction to problem-solving, and creative ambition.</p>
